Spent a couple hours going through the lab handbook in detail
and kept notes [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16ehrCBZl0fjLNjOuTc1fYY514VA4hyoEvZOq8rZPLb8/edit?usp=sharing). I double checked all URLs and checked grammar/comprehensibility, etc. Got through the majority of the lab culture section.
