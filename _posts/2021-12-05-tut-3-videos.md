title: Tidymodels Resampling Tutorial Videos
---

Hi everyone, I finished going through Tidymodels tutorial 3 (random forest models and resampling), and thought it would be helpful to create some videos going through it step by step. I hope this is useful for those that have not run through the tutorial on their own but want to access some information from it. I created 3 videos that can definitely be watched at 1.5x speed. Hope these are useful! :)

The first video I made is an introduction to the dataset and data manipulation for this tutorial.
