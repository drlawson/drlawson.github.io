I staged gonad slides for Matt using the same methods as my capstone. I took 
images of the slides under a microscope at 4x, 10x, and 40x and then used multiple 
sources to figure out what each stage looked like for this species (linked below). 

Based on what I saw in these slides, the diploid oysters exhibited mostly mature gonads, stage 3 (n=7). Two diploid oysters exhibited stage 2 gonads (late growth stage). Another 2 diploid oysters exhibited stage 0 gonads (resting stage). One diploid oyster could not be staged because there was very little gonad tissue provided (D02). 

On the other hand, the triploid oysters exhibited mostly stage 0 gonads (n=10), and 2 triploid oysters exhibited stage 1 (early growth stage) and were oligo females.

*Oligo females: "In oligo (Greek, meaning few) females, none or a few oocytes were observed among all
follicles" (Matt & Allen Jr 2021)*

- this may be early spawning due to the open space within follicles:
