title: Tidymodels Resampling Tutorial Videos
---

Hi everyone, I finished going through Tidymodels tutorial 3 (random forest models and resampling), and thought it would be helpful to create some videos going through it step by step. I hope this is useful for those that have not run through the tutorial on their own but want to access some information from it. I created 3 videos that can definitely be watched at 1.5x speed. Hope these are useful! :)

[Tidymodels Tutorial link](https://www.tidymodels.org/start/resampling/)

The first video I made is an introduction to the dataset and data manipulation for this tutorial.

The second video introduces random forest models, linking the model to the data, and analyzing model performance without the use of resampling.

The third video shows how to use resampling to improve model accuracy.
