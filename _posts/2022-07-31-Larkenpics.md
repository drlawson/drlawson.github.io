title: Larken Pictures
---

I came into the lab on Tuesday July 26th and took pictures of Larken’s histology samples. I was able to get through ½ of the samples (n=50), and took pictures on 4x, 10x, and 40x. I labeled all the pictures and tried to upload them to [this owl file](http://owl.fish.washington.edu/hesperornis/Larken_clam/). However, I ran out of time and was not able to add all of them to the file - I will continue uploading them when I return next week to finish taking the rest of the pictures. 

I used the microscope in the lab with the attached camera to take the images and it was much easier than using my phone to take pictures through a microscope lens! :)
