Video number one addresses network statistics, the Les Mis dataset, and the data manipulation performed in the tutorial (8:54).

Video number two introduces the Louvain algorithm and creates multiple versions of the network in order to see what the code does and how it can change the end result ().

I highly recommend trying this out if you have a few spare minutes, it is genuinely fun to challenge yourself to make a prettier graph than the one they made in the tutorial :) Hope you all enjoy/learn something new!
