title: Tidymodels Resampling Tutorial Videos
---

Hi everyone, I finished going through Tidymodels tutorial 3 (random forest models and resampling), and thought it would be helpful to create some videos going through it step by step. I hope this is useful for those that have not run through the tutorial on their own but want to access specific information from the tutorial. :)

[Tidymodels Tutorial link](https://www.tidymodels.org/start/resampling/)

The first video I made is an introduction to the dataset and data manipulation for this tutorial. 
(4:59)

The second video introduces random forest models, linking the model to the data, and analyzing model performance without the use of resampling. (8:02)

The third video shows how to use resampling to improve model accuracy.
