I am in the process of completing my undergraduate capstone in the UW Roberts lab, analyzing the maturation of the basket cockle C. nuttallii as it relates to 
the aquaculture of the species.

### More Information

My interests in the field of marine biology are centered around aquaculture, 
primarily with regards to finfish.
