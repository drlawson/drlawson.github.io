title: Staging for Matt Part 2
---

I worked on staging diploid and triploid oyster samples for Matt. I took pictures of each
H&E slide under a microscope under 4x, 10x, and 100x magnifications and recorded findings in
this [google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fqYHdkFAxkhkaCjyz1m-wtLuHCWAQXIDzCgza5Ya_9I/edit?usp=sharing). 

While staging diploids I used techniques/findings from [this paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/340952942_Reproductive_cycle_of_the_non-native_Pacific_oyster_Crassostrea_gigas_in_the_Adriatic_Sea). While staging triploids I used techniques from [this paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0044848620329306?casa_token=tqUzcpjXG-wAAAAA:doKCwVDSAQeaG8wClipCHG5kGXUbfCqvFwke0EE_JrXOAbedIjBtddc33xq8GH78lFMBtlvUIQ).

In a [previous notebook post](https://drlawson.github.io/Updated-Oyster-Pics-for-Matt/) I included pictures of each diploid and triploid stage. In this post, I will be posting images that I was not certain about in hopes that someone will be able to help me figure those out.

I had trouble figuring out if this individual (diploid) was spent or if the quality of the sample was just low. For reference, here is an image of a spent female from a [research paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/340952942_Reproductive_cycle_of_the_non-native_Pacific_oyster_Crassostrea_gigas_in_the_Adriatic_Sea).

I did not know how to label this individual either. I'm just not quite sure what I am looking at with this sample.

I did not know if this was gonad tissue or digestive tissue or what I was seeing here. 



One type of triploid that I did not observe last time was virilescent females - classified by the presence of spermatogenic cells within follicles lined with Beta gonia. Here are some images of virilescent females observed during this round of sampling: 
[X48_10x]
[X48_40x]
[T55_10x]
[T55_40x]

Thanks for taking the time to read this! :)
